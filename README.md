# Apex AFK Farm Bot

Based on [apexAFKfarmbot](https://github.com/iIndrasura/apexAFKfarmbot) for inspiration

The Apex AFK Farm Bot is a powerful automation tool designed to assist Apex Legends players in farming in-game rewards while being AFK (Away From Keyboard). This repository provides the source code and instructions for using the bot effectively.
This script automates certain actions in the game using Python libraries such as pyautogui, keyboard, and PyScreeze. It simulates human behavior by interacting with the game interface based on screen recognition.

## FEATURES
**WORKS WITH SEASON 19 - ONLY 1920x1080 16:9**

- auto restart game on set interval (default = 10800)
- WHY: on low performance systems sometimes due to low memory game would freeze randomly after some hours
With this automatic restart it runs 12+ hours tested
- anti-kick
- auto start matchmaking
- getting out of news, battlepass windows etc.
- remembering how much XP you got in a session
- remembering how much time you farmed in a session
