## GENERAL

Based on [apexAFKfarmbot](https://github.com/iIndrasura/apexAFKfarmbot) for inspiration

The Apex AFK Farm Bot is a powerful automation tool designed to assist Apex Legends players in farming in-game rewards while being AFK (Away From Keyboard). This repository provides the source code and instructions for using the bot effectively.
This script automates certain actions in the game using Python libraries such as pyautogui, keyboard, and PyScreeze. It simulates human behavior by interacting with the game interface based on screen recognition.

## FEATURES
**WORKS WITH SEASON 19 - ONLY 1920x1080 16:9**
- starting the game automatically
- auto restart game on set interval (default = 9000)
- WHY: on low performance systems sometimes due to low memory game would freeze randomly after some hours<br />
  With this automatic restart it runs 12+ hours tested
- anti-kick
- auto start matchmaking
- getting out of news, battlepass windows etc.
- remembering how much XP you got in a session
- remembering how much time you farmed in a session<br />
- restart matchmaking if stuck
- see average XP / HOUR gained
- legend select
- DEBUG: see how many matches OCR for EXP didn't work

## PREREQUISITES
- PYTHON (if you want to use directly the source code)
- WINDOWS 64 BIT (if you use the executable)

   NOTE: To test, open cmd and type tesseract, if command is not found, repeat steps

**Apex Farmer**
- To setup, on first run it will generate a config.ini file which you need to edit with your Apex directory and time for restart

## Installation
- WINDOWS installation
    1. Download executable from [release](https://github.com/letsmokee/ApexXPFarmer/releases/)
    2. Run the executable, on first run it will generate a config.ini file which you need to edit with your Apex directory and time for restart
    3. Follow the on screen instructions
       
## CONFIG.INI
 ```
[CONFIG]
time = 9000 -> time to restart game in seconds
apexdir = C:\Program Files\EA Games\Apex\\r5apex.exe -> Apex directory and executable (if using steam, delete the path and just write "steam")
ocr_debug = 0 -> EXP OCR debug mode (make screenshots to see debug why OCR didn't work)
show_exp = 1 -> -> if you want to show experience gained
champion = Lifeline -> Legend that you want to select

[KEYBINDS]
crouch_key = c -> Your crouch key
heal_key = 4 -> Your healing key
ability_key = q -> Your ability key
custom_key1 = -> Custom key if you want (leave blank if you don't want any custom key)
custom_key2 = -> Custom key if you want (leave blank if you don't want any custom key)

[FARM TOGETHER]
leader = FALSE -> Set this to **TRUE** for party leader account and **SLAVE** for party invitees accounts
account_1 = None -> Set this to Account 1 name if leader is **TRUE** or with party leader name if **SLAVE** is set
account_2 = None -> Set this to Account 2 name if leader is **TRUE**
```
 For Legend selection use one of the following:
 **"Bloodhound","Gibraltar","Lifeline","Pathfinder","Wraith","Bangalore","Caustic","Mirage","Octane","Wattson","Crypto","Revenant","Loba","Rampart","Horizon","Fuse","Valkyrie","Seer","Ash","MadMaggie","Newcastle","Vantage","Catalyst","Ballistic","Conduit"**

**NOTE: For now, only Ashe, Vangalore, Bloodhound, Catalyst, Conduit, Fuse, Gibraltar, Horizon, Lifeline, Loba, Newcastle, Octane, Pathfinder, Revenant, Rampart, Seer, Valkyrie, Wraith, MadMaggie, Caustic, Mirage, Crypto  are working**

## FARM TOGETHER (BETA, STILL TESTING)
For [Farm Together] feature to work read below:
1. Set **LEADER** to **TRUE** on your computer/virtual machine which you want to be the party leader
2. Set the **LEADER** to **SLAVE** for 1 or 2 other accounts that you want to farm with
3. For party leader: In the field Account 1 and/or Account 2 set the name of the account that you want to invite
4. For party invitees: In the field Account 1 set the name of the party leader account, leave Account 2 on None
5. Set the same time for restart
6. Set different Legend from account to account to be selected
7. Start the bots from same state (in-game or game not launched) at the same time

**NOTES**
- if you want to turn off the feature, just set **LEADER** to **FALSE**. You can leave the account names.
- it's using OCR so probably not all names will be recognized. In the next version I can implement custom screenshots for it to work better, but harder to setup.

## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
If you encounter any problem, open a cmd window where executable is, type 'ApexFarmer.exe' and run the script as normal. When the error will occur, cmd window will not close itself
- Open an issue with the error code.
